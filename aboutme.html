										<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/bm_github.jpg" alt="BM" /></span>Hi there! I am Bidyut Mukherjee, a second year Computer Science grad student at the University of Missouri-Columbia, pursuing Master's Degree. I believe anything that exists in "real life", can be recreated using computers. And more! Are we there yet? I don't think so. <b>Should</b> we be there? Ask me in ten years. Should we keep trying? Why yes, yes we should. Every fragment of this field is pushing our imaginations through leaps and bounds. Every problem we solve, brings more questions than answers that need further studying and exploration. We are in such an age where many of the sub-fields in this branch of science don't even have a formal definition! <i>*cough* Cloud Computing *cough*</i>. Things are getting more and more exciting, and we are so far from the true potential of this nascent field. I am but just another avid student trying to unravel the mysteries of this crazy, unstable field. That's one of my passions in life. I am very interested in the field of Cloud Computing, Ubiquitous Computing (IoT), Edge/Fog Networking, Operating System (Linux FTW!), System Programming, High Performance Computing (#CUDAisAwesome), and Mobile Computing, to name a few. I enjoy developing mobile applications for use on both Android and iOS (Swift. Not a big fan of Objective-C). I am a big proponent of Open Source Software, and the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid!). Coincidentally, the latter is also the motto of my linux distro of choice, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>.</p>
										<p>Twice a week, I indulge in Swing Dance. I enjoy both East Coast Swing and West Coast Swing. Two extremely, and yet different, dance forms. In my "free time", (Grad student... free time, haha!), I like to read novels (fantasy, fiction, thriller, mystery, etc). Currently, I am catching up on Rick Riordan's <i>Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard</i>. Rick's mythology-based fiction novels are amazing! I truly was hooked by his unique take on fusing together fantasy, fiction, and mythology.
										In addition, I enjoy playing the guitar, the keyboard, listening to music (classics, acoustics, country, pop, blues, and folk!), and watching TV series. (Doctor Who, Eureka, House of Cards, Game of Thrones, House MD, these are few of the badass ones).</p>
										<p>Anyway, back to science, there are a few other fields I take an amateur interest in. I get excited over Astronomy, Biology, and Theoretical Physics. Nature documentaries can certainly keep me engaged for a while. Space-time talk, on the other hand, could distract me from almost anything I might be doing at the time. Science is SO DARN EXCITING!</p>
										<p>I will continue to update the contents of the website with my updated Résumé, upcoming publications, and details about few of the projects I have been/am involved in. Hopefully, it helps you, the reader, in some way as well. Thanks for reading!</p>
										<p>-BM</p>
